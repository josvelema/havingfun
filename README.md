Hi! If you're reading this it means you seem to have interests in my code try-outs.
As simple the code may be , i had great fun making it and i will post new try-outs every now and then.
Some may contain challenges as given in the code institute so if you're a mentor/tutor from code institute i would love to hear
your feedback! Ofcourse other coders/developpers do not hesitate to share youre thoughts.
greeting
